# Dance Style Recognition: A Machine Learning Approach

This repository contains machine learning models to classify dance styles (pop, rock, EDM, jazz, and lofi) based on sensory data collected from an individual.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
  * Collection of sensory data (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope) using mobile devices.
  * Data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
* **Model Development:**
  * Implementation of machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks) to classify dance styles based on sensory data.
  * Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
* **Model Evaluation:**
  * Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  * Visualization of model predictions and error analysis.

By running the Jupyter Notebook, you can:

* Explore the potential of machine learning in recognizing dance styles from sensory data.
* Gain insights into the distinguishing features of different dance genres.
* Evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning models for this task.
